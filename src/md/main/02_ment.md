# The Mentor

## Role of the Mentors

To each tutor group, one or more higher-year students are assigned as
*mentors*. The mentors are recruited by Incognito. The work of the
mentors complements the tutor's work on a more informal,
student-to-student basis.

## Tasks of the Mentors

-   The mentors are required to partake in the mentor training (during
    the summer break)

-   The mentors are required to be present at the introduction day and
    the break day.

-   The mentors organize two 'mentoretentjes' with their group during
    the first year (they get a budget from Incognito).

-   The mentors create a Whatsapp group (which can be used for
    communication and as a social safety net and for easy promotion by
    Incognito, so the first years will get involved).

-   The mentors promote good study habits (attending lectures, etc.)

-   The mentors keep an eye out for struggling students and pass the
    information on to the tutors.
