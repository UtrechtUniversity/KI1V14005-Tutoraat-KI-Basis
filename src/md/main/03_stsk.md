# Student Tasks

The students have to:

-   do a preparation exercise for the break day meeting,

-   fill in two reflection forms, one in preparation of the progress
    meeting and one in preparation of the choice meeting (deadlines in
    the program),

-   attend the three meetings and the break day.

Nothing happens if the students don't fulfill their obligations but
don't tell them that. It's for their own good.
