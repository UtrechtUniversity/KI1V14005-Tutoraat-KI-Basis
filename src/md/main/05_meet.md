# Meeting Guidelines

The following are non-binding guidelines, feel free to do this in any
way you please as long as you reach the aims.

## Get-to-know Meeting

-   **Form**: Group meeting.

-   **Aims**:

    -   tutor and students introduce themselves to each other

    -   information about the tutoring program is dispersed

    -   expectations for block 1 are discussed

-   **Preparation** (Students): None.

-   **Preparation** (Tutor): Familiarize yourself with the program.

-   **Proposed Schedule** (ca. 1h):

    1.  Tutor introduces themselves (background, teaching, research) and
        gives contact info (email, office hours if available).

    2.  Tutor answers questions about program and gives schedule for
        future meetings.

    3.  Students introduce themselves (e.g. say your name, your favorite
        X, and all the names and X's of people before you).

    4.  Tips and tricks activity (slips (see appendix) are distributed
        to the students, each student asks another student the question
        on their slip by name, answers are shared by group, tutor, and
        mentors)

    5.  Open end, fade into mentor activities.

-   **Remarks**:

    -   If you have more than one group, an ad hoc solution for the
        meetings is to let the mentors run them and go back-and-forth
        between the two groups. We'll think about a general solution.

    -   The above schedule is just a suggestion, there are other ways to
        conduct the meeting, it's up to you. E.g. some tutors have had
        the mentors explain the program (using an INCOGNITO issued
        guideline, I'll see if I can get it) first.

## Break Day Meeting

-   **Form**: Group meeting.

-   **Aims**:

    -   reflection on experiences in block 1

    -   planning of further meetings

    -   re-establish contact

-   **Preparation** (Students): Answer the questionnaire and put it on
    BB.

-   **Preparation** (Tutor): Have a look at the questionnaire. (But no
    need to read all the answers)

-   **Proposed Schedule** (ca. 1h):

    -   Tutor opens the meeting: (re)-introduces themselves, explains
        the purpose of and plan for the meeting.

    -   Question activity: the students have prepared answers to a
        series of questions as the basis for the meeting:

        -   Try to get the students to talk about this.

        -   Start with the "funniest moment" to break the ice.

        -   Move to more difficult issues.

        -   Encourage the group to share.

        -   **Identify students to talk to individually.**

    -   Tutor closes the meeting: mentions further meetings (progress +
        choice, possibly scheduling them), repeats how to reach them.

-   **Remarks**: If you have more than one group, an ad hoc solution for
    the meetings is to let the mentors run them and go back-and-forth
    between the two groups. We'll think about a general solution.

## Progress Meeting

-   **Form**: Individual meetings

-   **Aims**:

    -   check in with the students

    -   identify students who are struggling and help find solutions

    -   identify students who want to make use of the February 1 rule
        for unenrollment

-   **Preparation** (Students): Fill in the reflection form, submit on
    BB, **deadline**: 21/12/2019

-   **Preparation** (Tutor): Read the reflection forms filled in by the
    students.

-   **Proposed Schedule** (ca. 10-15 minutes per meeting):

    -   Ask the student how they are doing (which courses did they
        pass/fail, is there something they're struggling with---offer
        pointers if needed)

    -   Ask the student if they know about the BSA and if they think
        they'll get it (offer info if needed, explain the Februrary 1
        rule)

    -   Mention that there will be another meeting about choice of
        track.

    -   If you think a student is honors material, point them towards
        that (link in the appendix).

    -   Look at the curriculum (excel sheet on BB) together with the
        student, explain the courses that are coming up (upshot:
        Inleiding Logica en tot Cognitiewetenschappen are relatively
        easy, block 2 courses are hard but it get's (somewhat) easier
        again)

    -   Give room for questions (typical questions at this stage: minor,
        studying abroad, additional courses/honors, writing problems,
        psychological problems, problems with course registration---see
        appendix with info about this issues)

-   **Remarks**.

    -   It would be nice if you could keep a list (confidential) of who
        you think is at risk for failing their BSA. We'll do some
        statistics at the end of term.

    -   You don't need to give an advise yourself to the student
        (continue or discontinue), you help them make an informed
        decision themselves (they are adults). Help them find the
        information they need (using the resources in the appendix).

    -   Doodle (<https://doodle.com>) can be used fruitfully for letting
        students sign-up for the meeting (create a doodle with the
        time-slots you have available, allow each participant to only
        select one option, make sure that participants can't see each
        others selections).

    -   If you need to book a room, contact the OW secretaries (see
        Appendix).

    -   **Afterwards, please create a note in Osiris docent (see
        Appendix) containing any important information that's been
        discussed in the meeting.**

## Choice Meeting

    - Option 2: Group meeting
