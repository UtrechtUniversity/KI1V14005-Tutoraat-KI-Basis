## About

This document contains a guideline for tutors and mentors of first-year
students in the bachelor program *Kunstmatige Intelligentie* at Utrecht
University. See:
<https://students.uu.nl/gw/ki/praktische-zaken/begeleiding-en-advies>

## WIP

This guideline is work-in-progress. I\'m sharing it here to facilitate
collaboration, feedback, and in the spirit of open science.

## Instructions

If you want to contribute, please try to use the usual github channels:
open an issue, propose changes, make a pull request, ...

To get started, have a look here:
<https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests>

## Principles

I try to adhere to the following principles, I\'d like to ask all
collaborators to do the same:

-   Less is more Provide only to the point information that can actually
    be read.

These principles will be updated.

## Dependencies

The guideline is typeset using my uureport class, which you can find
