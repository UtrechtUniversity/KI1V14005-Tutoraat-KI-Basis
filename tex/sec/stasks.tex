\chapter{Student Tasks}

The students have to:

	\begin{itemize}

		\item do a preparation exercise for the break day meeting,

		\item fill in two reflection forms, one in preparation of the progress meeting and one in preparation of the choice meeting (deadlines in the program),

		\item attend the three meetings and the break day.

	\end{itemize}

Nothing happens if the students don't fulfill their obligations but don't tell them that.
It's for their own good.
