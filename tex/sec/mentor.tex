\chapter{The Mentor}

\section{Role of the Mentors}

To each tutor group, one or more higher-year students are assigned as \emph{mentors}.
The mentors are recruited by Incognito.
The work of the mentors complements the tutor's work on a more informal, student-to-student basis.

\section{Tasks of the Mentors}

\begin{itemize}

	\item The mentors are required to partake in the mentor training (during the summer break)

	\item The mentors are required to be present at the introduction day and the break day.

	\item The mentors organize two `mentoretentjes' with their group during the first year (they get a budget from Incognito).

	\item The mentors create a Whatsapp group (which can be used for communication and as a social safety net and for easy promotion by Incognito, so the first years will get involved).

	\item The mentors promote good study habits (attending lectures, etc.)

	\item The mentors keep an eye out for struggling students and pass the information on to the tutors.

\end{itemize}
