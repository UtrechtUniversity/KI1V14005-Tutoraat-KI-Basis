\chapter{Osiris Docent}

Osiris docent gives you access to the students' progress reports.
Here you can also create notes about your meeting in order to document important information about what's been discussed.
\textbf{When you create a note make sure to choose the right visibility setting (``strictly confidential'').}

More information about Osiris docent (including a manual) is available under: \url{https://intranet.uu.nl/osiris-docent}.
In the manual (link on the right-hand side of the page), you can find a step-by-step explanation for how to create progress reports and notes.
I've put the manual (in Dutch) also on Blackboard.
